RESTy Phase 1: Begin work on the RESTy API testing application

Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as we go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner

The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

As a user, I expect an easy to read and understand user interface so that I can use the application intuitively
As a user, I want to enter the URL to a REST API and select the REST method to use to access it
As a user, I want visual confirmation that my entries and selections are valid so that I have confidence the application will be able to fetch the API data that Iâ€™ve requested
And as developers, here are the high level development tasks that address the above end user requirements


## Setup
 `npx create-react-app rusty `
 `npm install node-sass   `


## How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)
   * `npm start`
